variability-dimensions : plots the variability explained by each dimension

dimension1-2-3-4 : pltos the contrinution of each variable in the first four dimensions (the most relevant)

2Dplane-dimension1-dimension2 : plot to see how variables behave with respect to each other in the 2D space dim1/dim2
