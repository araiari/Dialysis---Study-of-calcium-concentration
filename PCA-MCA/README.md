The folder contains the code to perform a Principal Component Analysis on the continuous variables of the dataset.
The resulting principal components and loadings can be seen in the pdf file PCA_dat_modello.
As anticipated, from PCA it does not seem meaningful to reduce the dimensionality of data. 

Moreover there are contained the scripts about Multiple Correspondence Analysis, performed on the cathegorical variables of the dataset.
MCA gave us a first evidence that the measurements of calcium concentration are hospital dependent
(it can be explained by medical protocols, which might differ in different hospitals). 
In addition the usage of beta-blockers and insulin and the presence of diabetes seem to be relevant factors for the variability of calcium.
