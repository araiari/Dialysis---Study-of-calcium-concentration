# Statistical Analysis on Dialysis
## Study of calcium concentration

The aim of the research is to find a criterion to classify a patient according to his features. 
In particular, we aim to predict the growth of ionized and total calcium concentration in blood 
during the dialysis process through several variables. 

We are collaborating with the Departments of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano and MOX, 
that gave us the dataset to work with. 
Since the data are private, we will share the methods and the results without providing the original data.
