# Statistical Analysis on Dialysis

The aim of the research is to find a criterion to classify a patient according to his features. 
In particular, we aim to predict the growth of ionized and total calcium concentration in blood 
during the dialysis process through several variables. 

We are collaborating with the Departments of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano and MOX, 
that gave us the dataset to work with. 
Since the data are private, we will share the methods and the results without providing the original data.


#### Preliminary analysis
We started with a preliminary analysis to understand the relevance and the relationship between available features. 

PCA and correlation analysis for continuous variables and MCA for cathegoriacal variables were performed. 
PCA did not show any particoular dependence and did not allow us to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
Interesntig results were given by MCA, which evidentiate an high dependency of the data from the hospital.

In the respective folder, one can find the results.
